# Introduction {timing=15}

## Context {timing=60}

#### Policy decisions pose a complex, [wicked problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem) [^1] [^2]
- Effectiveness determined by solving it; single attempt
- Measuring impact will shift problem
- Public discourse helps shape solutions; crucial for policy-making

#### Determining public opinion
- Surveys and polls -> Social Media -> Discussion Platforms
- People willing to express freely
- Digital platforms provide a wealth of data
- Unstructured, vast, and complex

[^1]: characterized by no definitive formulation, no stopping rule, no specific optimization criteria, and no right/wrong solutions

## Topic Modeling {timing=30}

```{mermaid}
%% | file: /docs/topic-modeling.mmd
```

::: {.aside}
Pipeline implemented using [BERTopic framework](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/) [@grootendorst_bertopic_2022]
:::

## UMAP {timing=45}

- [Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/)
    - balances global structure against local relationships between data points
- [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) preserves global structure
- Optimized:
    - `n_neighbors`, `min_dist`, `n_components`, `metric`

```{mermaid .r-fit-text}

    Embeddings["Transfomer Embeddings \n 1024-4096 dimensions"] --> UMAP{"UMAP"}
    UMAP --> ReducedEmbeddings["Reduced Embeddings \n 10-100 dimensions"]
```

## HDBSCAN {timing=15}

- [Hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/)
- Unsupervised learning algorithm to find clusters (dense regions) in a dataset
- Default values generated reasonable results; optimized by hit-and-trial

## c-TF-IDF {timing=90}
- Goal: Identify most important words / phrases within each cluster / topic
- Count-based vectorizer transforms text into token-count matrix
- [Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) evaluates word importance
- BERTopic introduces Class-based TF-IDF [@grootendorst_bertopic_2022]

$$ \text{TF-IDF(word, cluster)} = \frac{\text{word's frequency within that cluster}}{\text{word's frequency in the entire dataset}} $$

- Used [Spacy](https://spacy.io/) to remove stop words and optimize signal-to-noise ratio
- Fed into a language model to generate concise topic labels

::: {.aside}
Equation is illustrative; actual calculations are more complex.
:::

## Argument Generation {timing=120}

- Actionable insights that urge for specific actions to address issues
- Problems and solutions proposed by participants
- LLM synthesizes arguments from comments within each topic
- Advocate for specific arguments urging actions to address issues
 - Filter these arguments to derive actionable insights

```{mermaid}
%%| file: /docs/arguments.mmd
```

## Argument Scoring {timing=90}

- Goal: Quantify acceptance of each generated argument
- Task: Identify comments that support each argument
- Count the individuals that voted positively on supporting comments
- Calculate an "acceptance" factor to indicate the degree of consensus

```{mermaid}
%%| file: /docs/argument-support.mmd
```

## Potential Biases in Argument Generation {timing=120}

- Some comments, especially those posted earlier, may receive more votes than others
    - Use the ratio of agreement votes to total votes

- Certain topics are more popular and have more comments than others
    - Generate a balanced number of arguments for each topic

- Certain controversial topics are heavily downvoted
    - Comments: Filter by quantiles instead of fixed thresholds within each topic
    - Arguments: Select fixed number of "best arguments" from each topic

- Some people vote more than others
    - Count the individuals that support an argument over hard vote count

## Argument Mapping {timing=60}
- Used [Argdown](https://argdown.org/) syntax to generate argument maps
- Developed a grammar generator to convert data into Argdown format
- Generated argument maps for each topic to visualize the structure of the debate

```argdown

# Argdown Syntax Example

[Statement]: Argdown is a simple syntax for defining argumentative structures, inspired by Markdown.
  + Writing a list of **pros & cons** in Argdown is as simple as writing a twitter message.
  + But you can also **logically reconstruct** more complex relations.
  + You can export Argdown as a graph and create **argument maps** of whole debates.
  - Not a tool for creating visualizations, but for **structuring arguments**.

<Argument>: Argdown is an excellent tool and should be used by the city of Bowling Green, KY.
