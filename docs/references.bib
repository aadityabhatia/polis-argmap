	volume = {552},
	abstract = {The term knowledge gardening, a contraction of the longer dynamic knowledge gardening (DKG), is a direct descendant of Douglas Engelbart's Dynamic Knowledge Repository (DKR). A DKR exists as a combination of humans and tools, epistemic communities and the tools they use to aggregate information resources and work products, and to collaborate. We describe TopicSpaces, an open source topic-map-based framework with which the collective hypermedia discourse of epistemic communities is federated. We define hypermedia discourse as the totality of social gestures made by such communities. That is, recorded dialogs, linked, annotated and tagged Web resources, recorded stories, virtually all addressable information resources created anywhere on the Web constitute the range of resources federated. We define federation of resources as the specific merging processes native to topic mapping. We contrast federation with traditional semantic integration processes where artifacts of knowledge are aggregated through processes of selection. Where selection processes involve "weeding" (a gardening process), federation does not perform weeding during the merge process; rather, federation involves including all resources during the merge process; social processes including reputation, trust, and dialog will help determine which resources users find most valuable in their work. TopicSpaces provides a map of the federated territory, user interface tools to facilitate some hypermedia discourse practices, and Web services to interface with other hypermedia discourse tools.},

This paper briefly introduces the concept of GCI as well as why it is a system of collective optimization, and explores why “wicked problems” from the perspective of GCI are collective optimization problems, and therefore why such problems might require GCI to be reliably solvable.},

In this paper, we present “D-agree,” a crowd-scale discussion support system based on an automated facilitation agent. The agent extracts discussion structures from online discussions, analyzes them, and posts facilitation messages. We conducted small- and large-scale social experiments in Japan to assess the social impact of the platform. The results showcase the success of our automated facilitation agents in gathering valuable opinions from citizens. In addition, our experiments highlight the effect of an automated facilitation agent on online discussions. In particular, we find that combining the agent facilitator with human facilitators leads to higher user satisfaction.},

To facilitate these discussions proceeding smoothly and reaching consensus efficiently, human facilitators are introduced into these discussions. However, human facilitator-related problems such as human bias and scalability arise with the increasing sophistication of these online discussions. As a result, it becomes critical to find approaches that support facilitation in these online discussions. Towards this end, we propose a novel case-based reasoning framework to support online discussion facilitation. In the proposed framework (CBR), each discussion thread is styled using an issue-based information system (IBIS), where complex problems are modeled as argumentation processes among several stack holders. Upon identifying a new discussion case, facilitation suggestions are generated by retrieving the most similar facilitated case from the discussion case base. For the sake of experimental evaluation, we build an online facilitation dataset that contains the facilitation information from annotated real-world discussion data. The experimental results show the validity of the generated facilitation suggestions.},

This comes at a time when people are led to alternative spaces of political expression as traditional channels become strained. New technologies appear to have a transformational potential that could lead to social change and achieve deeper and wider mobilisation in political processes. However, people still face challenges when seeking information, disseminating information, or engaging in online deliberation. Allowing every citizen to participate in discussions and thus influence the final decision requires countless interactions that take considerable amounts of time and energy. This process is cognitively demanding due to linguistic barriers or when the problems on the table are multidisciplinary. We envision in this blue sky paper the development of autonomous and intelligent conversational agents that can augment the deliberative capacities of citizens in social media. To implement our vision, we start by proposing an approach that quantifies deliberation in online argumentative discussions. Then, we propose a methodology to optimise deliberation across discussion threads. The proposed concept is expected to pave the way to a form of augmented democratic deliberation built on the cooperation of humans and conversational agents.},

CI can predict performance in a range of out-of-sample criterion tasks. CI, in turn, is most strongly predicted by group collaboration process, followed by individual skill and group composition.

Here, we analyze data on group performance from 22 studies, including 5,279 individuals in 1,356 groups. Our results support the conclusion that a robust CI factor characterizes a group’s ability to work together across a diverse set of tasks. We further show that CI is predicted by the proportion of women in the group, mediated by average social perceptiveness of group members, and that it predicts performance on various out-of-sample criterion tasks. We also find that, overall, group collaboration process is more important in predicting CI than the skill of individual members.},

            Active inference is a way of understanding sentient behavior—a theory that characterizes perception, planning, and action in terms of probabilistic inference. Developed by theoretical neuroscientist Karl Friston over years of groundbreaking research, active inference provides an integrated perspective on brain, cognition, and behavior that is increasingly used across multiple disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy. Active inference puts the action into perception. This book offers the first comprehensive treatment of active inference, covering theory, applications, and cognitive domains.
            Active inference is a “first principles” approach to understanding behavior and the brain, framed in terms of a single imperative to minimize free energy. The book emphasizes the implications of the free energy principle for understanding how the brain works. It first introduces active inference both conceptually and formally, contextualizing it within current theories of cognition. It then provides specific examples of computational models that use active inference to explain such cognitive phenomena as perception, attention, memory, and planning.},

In particular, we find that summarization capabilities enable categorically new methods with immense promise to empower the public in collective meaning-making exercises. And notably, LLM context limitations have a significant impact on insight and quality of these results. However, these opportunities come with risks. We discuss some of these risks, as well as principles and techniques for characterizing and mitigating them, and the implications for other deliberative or political systems that may employ LLMs. Finally, we conclude with several open future research directions for augmenting tools like Polis with LLMs.},

	abstract = {Collective intelligence, an emergent phenomenon in which a composite system of multiple interacting agents performs at levels greater than the sum of its parts, has long compelled research efforts in social and behavioral sciences. To date, however, formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local-scale interactions between autonomous sub-system components (individuals) and global-scale behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper we use the Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of any non-equilibrium steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal agent-based model that simulates the relationship between local individual-level interaction and collective intelligence. We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF agents (Model 1) with specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model 2), Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4). These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive ability are motivated by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist and flourish in an environment populated by other highly autonomous AIF agents, and have also recently been shown to map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise cognitive transitions increase system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for alignment between agents’ local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the dynamics of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed exogenously by incentives to agents’ behaviors (contra existing computational models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors for collective behavior (contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light on the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective intelligence in human and other complex adaptive systems.},

Particular attention is given to the challenge of negotiating the overheads of capturing this form of rationale. Our approach has maintained a strong emphasis on keeping the representational scheme as simple as possible to enable real time meeting mediation and capture, attending explicitly to the skills required to use the approach well, particularly for the sort of participatory, multi-stakeholder requirements analysis demanded by many design problems. However, we can then specialize the notation and the way in which the tool is used in the service of specific methodologies, supported by a customizable hypermedia environment, and interoperable with other software tools. After presenting this approach, called Compendium, we present examples to illustrate the capabilities for support security argumentation in requirements engineering, template driven modeling for document generation, and IBIS-based indexing of and navigation around video records of meetings.},

	abstract = {Humanity now finds itself faced with pressing and highly complex problems – such as climate change, the spread of disease, international and economic security, and so on - that call upon us to bring together large numbers of experts and stakeholders to deliberate collectively on a global scale. Such large-scale deliberations are themselves complex processes, however, with emergent properties that often prevent us from adequately harnessing the community's collective wisdom. Collocated meetings, beside being expensive, are prone to such well-known effects as polarization, power dynamics, and groupthink. Social media (such as email, blogs, wikis, chat rooms, and web forums) enable more concurrent input but still typically generate more heat than light when applied to complex controversial topics. Large-scale argumentation systems represent a promising approach for addressing this important challenge, by virtue of providing a simple systematic structure that radically reduces redundancy and encourages clarity. This paper will describe the efforts we have made to explore this approach, giving an overview of the key underlying concepts, the ways we have translated these concepts into a working system (the MIT Deliberatorium), and the experiences we have had evaluating this system in a range of contexts.},

This paper describes the collaboration as a case study of university researchers interacting with company executives to explore the potential of a new approach for undertaking organizational design. The joint CIDL-CSLI project involved 38 executives from across Takeda applying principles from Thomas Malone’s book Superminds to address an important business problem: how to use innovative socio-technical solutions to tackle depression among working age people in Japan.The Takeda executives, called “Superminds Fellows,” participated in a series of face-to-face and virtual meetings that were informed by ideas from the fields of collective intelligence and design thinking. The Takeda group generated six business concepts to address the challenge, and a group of researchers convened by the CIDL and the Community Biotechnology Initiative (CBI) of MIT’s  Media Lab subsequently commented and expanded on these concepts. The ideas generated by the Takeda executives and the MIT group were then synthesized by the CIDL team and reviewed by all participants. The concept that emerged was CareNet, a web-enabled collected intelligence system that relies on a combination of human expertise and artificial intelligence to diagnose and recommend actions that can help people who are susceptible to or suffering from depression, as well as their caregivers and healthcare providers. The collaboration yielded multi-faceted results. First, Takeda is developing the CareNet business concept by working with key stakeholders in the Japanese healthcare system. Second, the superminds concepts introduced to the Takeda executives who participated have begun to proliferate across the organization. For instance, even though only 38 executives participated directly in the Superminds Fellows program, a Takeda survey found that through the end of 2019, more than 200 people at the firm have become familiar with the supermind concepts at the center of the CIDL-CSLI collaboration. Finally, for CIDL, the collaboration led to the development of new elements of its superminds design methodology and also provided insights into how universities can undertake activities that combine some of the benefits of both traditional university research and management consulting.},

To this end, we leverage a recently introduced dataset containing group discussions of people collaborating to solve a task. To find out what makes someone change their mind, we incorporate various techniques such as neural text classification and language-agnostic change point detection. Evaluation of these methods shows that while the task is not trivial, the best way to approach it is using a language-aware model with learning-to-rank training. Finally, we examine the cues that the models develop as indicative of the cause of a change of mind.},

These systems integrate bridging-based ranking algorithms - including group informed consensus implemented in Polis and the continuous matrix factorization approach implemented by Twitter Birdwatch - making it possible to highlight statements which enjoy broad support from a diversity of opinion groups. Polis has been productively employed to foster more constructive political deliberation at nation scale in law making exercises. Twitter Birdwatch is implemented with the intention of addressing misinformation in the global public square. From one perspective, Twitter Birdwatch can be viewed as an anti-misinformation system which has deliberative aspects. But it can also be viewed as a first step towards a generalized deliberative system, using Twitter's misinformation problem as a proving ground. In this paper, we propose that Twitter could adapt Birdwatch to produce maps of public opinion. We describe a system in five parts for generalizing Birdwatch: activation of a deliberative system and topic selection, population sampling and the role of expert networks, deliberation, reporting interpretable results and finally distribution of the results to the public and those in power.},

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in addressing this challenge due to their remarkable capabilities in comprehending human opinions and generating human-like text. However, they typically rely on extensive human-annotated data. In this paper, we propose Self-Agreement, a novel framework for fine-tuning LLMs to autonomously find agreement using data generated by LLM itself. Specifically, our approach employs the generative pre-trained transformer-3 (GPT-3) to generate multiple opinions for each question in a question dataset and create several agreement candidates among these opinions. Then, a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based model evaluates the agreement score of each agreement candidate and selects the one with the highest agreement score. This process yields a dataset of question-opinion-agreements, which we use to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM for discovering agreements among diverse opinions. Remarkably, a pre-trained LLM fine-tuned by our Self-Agreement framework achieves comparable performance to GPT-3 with only 1/25 of its parameters, showcasing its ability to identify agreement among various opinions without the need for human-annotated data.},

	abstract = {Argument structure extraction is a fundamental problem in argumentation mining which aims at automatically constructing arguments from unstructured textual documents. Re-garding each argument as a node, then predicting relationships of those nodes is a key task for argument structure extraction, which is called link prediction. Graph neural networks (GNN), as an efficient approach to cope with graphical data, have shown good performances on link prediction tasks. However, they usually focus on predicting whether parts of links really exist in one argument graph, rather than predicting existence of the links between any two nodes, though it is more practical in real applications of argument mining. Thus, in this paper our goal is to predict links between any two nodes given only nodes information. This task is more difficult than the traditional link prediction tasks since the prediction scale exponentially increases with node number. We propose a GNN based model for link predic-tion which outputs the embedding of all the nodes. Then, the probability of link existence between any two nodes is calculated by their embedding results. Finally, we use a dataset of essay comments to perform evaluations and the results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

This observation poses a problem for how analysts choose a particular annotated dataset (from the group), or process the set of responses to give a “balanced” response, or whether to reject all the annotated datasets. A further important aspect of this book is the case studies which demonstrate that differences in judgments between fellow experts have been reported in a significant number of disciplines including, business, the law, government, and medicine. Kahneman, Sibony and Sunstein (2021), referred to as KSS subsequently, discuss how Expert Biases can be reduced, but the main focus of this book is a discussion of Noise, that is, differences that often occur between fellow experts, and how Noise can often be reduced. To address the last point KSS have formulated a set of six decision hygiene principles which include the recommendation that complex tasks should be subdivided, and then each subtask should be solved separately. A further principle is that each task should be solved by individual experts before the various judgments are discussed with fellow experts. Effectively, the book being reviewed covers three main topics: First, it reports several motivating studies that show how judgments of fellow experts varied significantly in the pricing of insurance premiums, and in setting the lengths of custodial sentences. These motivating studies very effectively illustrate the central concepts of Judgment, Noise, and Bias; that section also provides definitions of these core concepts and discusses how Noise is often amplified in group meetings. Secondly, the authors provide detailed discussion of further studies, in a variety of domains, which report the levels of disagreement between experts. Thirdly, KSS discusses how to reduce the levels of Noise between experts, as noted above, the authors refer to these as Principles of Noise Hygiene. These three parts are interwoven in a complex way throughout the book; in our view, the best overview of the book is given in the section Review and Conclusions: Taking Noise Seriously (KSS, p. 361).},

More specifically, BERTopic generates document embedding with pre-trained transformer-based language models, clusters these embeddings, and finally, generates topic representations with the class-based TF-IDF procedure. BERTopic generates coherent topics and remains competitive across a variety of benchmarks involving classical models and those that follow the more recent clustering approach of topic modeling.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629},
	abstract = {While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their abilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. action plan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34\% and 10\% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

	abstract = {Language models are increasingly being deployed for general problem solving across a wide range of tasks, but are still confined to token-level, left-to-right decision-making processes during inference. This means they can fall short in tasks that require exploration, strategic lookahead, or where initial decisions play a pivotal role. To surmount these challenges, we introduce a new framework for language model inference, Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which generalizes over the popular Chain of Thought approach to prompting language models, and enables exploration over coherent units of text (thoughts) that serve as intermediate steps toward problem solving. ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices. Our experiments show that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three novel tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Mini Crosswords. For instance, in Game of 24, while GPT-4 with chain-of-thought prompting only solved 4\% of tasks, our method achieved a success rate of 74\%.

	abstract = {Deliberative and participatory approaches to democracy seek to directly include citizens in decision-making and agenda-setting processes. These methods date back to the very foundations of democracy in Athens, where regular citizens shared the burden of governance and deliberated every major issue. However, thinkers at the time rightly believed that these methods could not function beyond the scale of the city-state, or polis. Representative democracy as an innovation improved on the scalability of collective decision making, but in doing so, sacrificed the extent to which regular citizens could participate in deliberation. Modern technology, including advances in computational power, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques, presents a unique opportunity to scale out deliberative processes. Here we describe Polis, an open source web application capable of collecting and synthesizing feedback from people in a scalable and distributed fashion. Polis has shown itself capable of building shared understanding, disincentivizing counterproductive behavior (trolling), and cultivating points of consensus. It has done this in the context of journalistic and academic research, and directly as part of decision-making bodies at local and national levels, directly affecting legislation. These results demonstrate that deliberative processes can be scaled up beyond the constraints of in-person gatherings and small groups.},

We pair these data with a survey experiment in which individuals are randomly assigned to see annotations to posts. We find that annotations selected by the algorithm improve key indicators compared with overall average and crowd-generated baselines. Further, when deployed on Twitter, people who saw annotations selected through this bridging-based approach were significantly less likely to reshare social media posts than those who did not see the annotations.},

The approach derives from hypertext research systems from the mid-1980s-90s which sought to manipulate conceptual structures as hypertextual concept maps. However, many did not receive sustained use due to issues of cognitive overheads and representational inflexibility. Many decided that such tools would never fulfill their promise. The gIBIS system exemplified this early work, but has since evolved into a broader approach to collective sensemaking called Compendium. We outline Compendium, which demonstrates the impact that a hypertext facilitator can have on the learning and adoption problems that often ambush hypertext sensemaking tools before they have the chance to establish roots in work practice.},
